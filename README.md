# Betriebsysteme(BICCS)
My personal notes for the semester course. System programming in Linux. Basically i will be keeping all the light things here,
sometimes is not easy to remember all the times i learn. This page will be my refresh page es live progress with a lot of stuffs.
Fill free to use the code and also learn from me as we go along. If you find any errors or disagreements you can always open an issue

###INTRODUCTION

    ##USEFUL BOOKS FOR THE SEMESTER
    * [The Linux Programming Interface](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593272203.do)

###LECTURE[1] Linux Filesystem and Management
    ##USEFUL METHODS
          #stat family
            *int stat (const char *path, struct stat *buf);
            *int fstat (int fd, struct stat *buf);
            *int lstat (const char *path, struct stat *buf);
            
            ##File permission bits
            * S_IFMT     0170000   bit mask for the file type bit field used with (mode & S_IFMT)
            
             Mash          | 12 Bits cor   | file type   | symbol
             --- |  --- | ---  | --- 
            | S_IFSOCK      | 0140000       |socket       | s     |
            | S_IFLNK       | 0120000       |symbolic link| l     |
            | S_IFREG       | 0100000       | regular file| -     | 
            | S_IFBLK       | 0060000       | block device| b     |
            | S_IFDIR       | 0040000       | directory   | d     |
            | S_IFCHR       | 0020000       | cha.-device | c     |
            | S_IFIFO       | 0010000       | FIFO        | p     |
            
 
 #more here [Linux man Page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html)
   ```c
   if ((statb.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFREG)   //with already defined macros is easy to test the file types
    printf("regular file\n");
   ```
   ```
   Constant Test macro File type
   S_IFREG S_ISREG()   Regular file
   S_IFDIR S_ISDIR()    Directory
   S_IFCHR S_ISCHR()   Character device
   S_IFBLK S_ISBLK()   Block device
   S_IFIFO S_ISFIFO()  FIFO or pipe
   S_IFSOCK S_ISSOCK()  Socket
   S_IFLNK S_ISLNK()    Symbolic link   
   ```
   
   ```c
   //useful printf formats
   %ld, (long) sb->st_ino  //cast the inodes to long
   %ld  (long) sb->st_nlink // number of hard links 
   UID=%ld   (long) sb->st_uid // user id
   GID=%ld   (long) sb->st_gid // group id
   %lld  (long long) sb->st_size, sb->st_blksize and sb->st_blocks
   %s  ctime(&sb->st_ctime.tv_sec) // tv_sc for time_t
, 
   
   ```

* Permission
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int chmod (const char *path, mode_t mode);
// needed to convert the user mode input [0600] to base 8 octal for the mode_t
long int strtol(const char *nptr, char **endptr, int base); 

int fchmod (int fd, mode_t mode);

//change owner
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
// getgranam needed to get the id of the user-group
struct group *getgrnam(const char *name);
//-1 is specified if it need to be unchanged ( uid_t owner, gid_t group)
int chown (const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);


int lchown (const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
int fchown (int fd, uid_t owner, gid_t group);


//file accessibility
#include <unistd.h>
int access(const char * pathname , int mode );
            Returns 0 if all permissions are granted, otherwise â€“1
    Constant Description   [man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/faccessat.2.html)
F_OK Does the file exist?
R_OK Can the file be read?
W_OK Can the file be written?
X_OK Can the file be executed?
```
